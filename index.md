# Phone Controlled Robot Arm
I am working on an Arduino robot arm that is controlled by an Android app of my design using MIT App Inventor.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was assembling my robot arm and controlling it from my computer. To accomplish this, I first got two servo motors working using a breadboard, and I programmed the Arduino to rotate the servos to a certain degree taking input from my computer using serial monitor. Then, I built the robot arm from the base to the head and claw of the arm. Finally, I got two more servos working and connected the four servos to the robot arm. By controlling the servo motors, I was able to to control the robot arm from my computer.
